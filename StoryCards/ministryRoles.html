<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="orphans: 4"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is ideal if all three leaders can meet ahead of time to rehearse the
story together. Wednesday night, when the church is open for prayer
group, worship rehearsal, confirmation class and knitting group, is a
good time to rehearse and if possible to take photos of the rehearsal
for the overhead projector and the church bulletin</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>The
Storyteller</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Storyteller uses
manipulatives and visual aids, to tell the story during “Children's
Chat” time in the chancel during the main church service. The
stories are taken directly from the Bible, retold in the
Storyteller's own words, but often utilizing direct quotes from
Scripture. The Storyteller focuses attention on the story, thereby
effacing himself or herself. At the end of the story, the Storyteller
dismisses the children, and hands the story materials to the Wonder
Leader to take into the Story room.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Storyteller then
participates normally in the adult worship. During the Prayers, the
Storyteller goes to tell the Doorkeeper that the service is almost
over.</FONT></P>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>The
Wonder Leader</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The Wonder Leader takes the
story materials out of the chancel into the Story Room. He or she
places the story materials in the middle of the Circle, and takes a
seat next to the focus shelves, facing the door. As each child enters
the room the Wonder Leader greets them by name, and helps them choose
a place in the circle to sit. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When all the children are
seated, the Wonder Leader leads them in their circle-song to help
them become quiet and focussed. As the song ends, the Wonder Leader
directs attention to the story materials, and begins to “wonder”
about them, inviting the children to join in the wondering.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When the wondering winds down,
the Wonder Leader asks the children to think about what work they
want to do. One by one each child is asked what work he or she wants
to do and is dismissed from the circle to get, first, his rug; and
second, his work materials, which may be art supplies, or story
manipulatives for that day's story or for a story that they have
heard previously.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When it is time to clean up,
the Wonder leader welcomes the children back into the circle, and
leads them in their sending song, dismissing them one by one by name
to line up at the door. </FONT>

<H2 CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=5>The
Doorkeeper</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">When the Storyteller dismisses
the children, the Doorkeeper leads the children up the main aisle of
the nave to the centre doors, and around to the long hallway to the
Story Room. At the door to the story room the Doorkeeper reminds the
children to “get ready” by being calm and quiet. As each child
becomes calm, the Doorkeeper invites him or her by name to enter the
story room, and then waits until that child is greeted by the Wonder
Leader and finds a seat, before inviting the next child to enter.
When all the children have entered, the Doorkeeper takes a seat
quietly just inside the closed door, waiting to help as needed. The
Doorkeeper may take a child to the washroom, help a child find his
art materials, invite a child to sit next to him or her if the child
cannot settle down in the circle. When notified by the Storyteller,
the Doorkeeper tells the children that it is time to clean up and may
help them put their work away. When the children are dismissed by the
Wonder leader, the Doorkeeper leads them back to the main doors of
the nave, and reminds them to enter the nave quietly without
disturbing the worship there.</FONT></P>
