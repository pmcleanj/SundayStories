<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3>Welcome to the Sunday
School plan for Emmanuel Community Church. Emmanuel is a member of
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. Lutheran tradition
provides strong foundational principles for teaching children: </FONT>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Scripture:
	</B>Luther taught that each Christian finds their relationship to
	God through Scripture, unmediated by any priest or special
	theological training. Foremost, before all else, our Sunday School
	tells the stories of Holy Scripture, simply as they appear in the
	Bible. We do not try to force any interpretation into the stories.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Inclusion</B>:
	Adults, children, teens: all of us who are baptized are equally part
	of the Body, equally members of &ldquo;the priesthood of all
	believers.&rdquo; The scripture story the children hear comes from
	the week's Revised Common Lectionary lessons that the adults hear.
	After church, parents and their children can share their responses
	to the same readings.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Worship</B>:
	Luther gave the church hymns in everyday language to popular tunes,
	so that God's people could respond from their hearts. Children
	respond in the same way as adults: through the arts, including music
	&ndash; often the same contemporary worship music being sung by
	their parents and grandparents.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1"><FONT SIZE=3>Our Sunday School
programme implements these principles by applying Montessori
education techniques, informed by the work of Montessori religious
educators Sophia Cavaletti (<I><U>The Religious Potential of the
Child</U></I>; <I><U>The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd</U></I>)
Jerome Berryman (<U>&ldquo;</U><I><U>Godly Play&rdquo;, Young
Children and Worship</U></I>) and Sonja Stewart (<I><U>Young Children
and Worship</U></I>, <I><U>Following Jesus: More About Young Children
and Worship</U></I>.) The stories are told with vivid, beautiful
materials that children can touch and see; and then associated back
to the Bible whence they come by iconic bookmarks. Children have
access to the story materials and to art supplies from which they may
choose their own response to the Scripture. Worship songs help the
children transition smoothely between the Sunday Story room and the
sanctuary. The following is the schedule of stories that will be told
in Fall of 2014.</FONT></P>

					the lesson's manipulatives. By seeing it next to the story
					manipulatives, children will associate it with the story, even
					when it is placed into the actual Bible. We will do this with
					every lesson, <I>adding </I>a new bookmark to the Bible each
					week, so that each week the children are reminded that they can
					access any of the stories they have already heard, just by going
					back to the Bible.</P>
					<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1">The song is a Taize-style
					worship song, using simple words and repetition so that the
					children can focus on the meaning of the words, and their
					feelings, instead of focussing on remembering the words. A
					similar song will be introduced later as a sending song. We will
					focus on having a few songs that the children know well, and
					introducing new songs very sowly. This way children take
					ownership of their worship expression and feel comfortable with
					it.</P>
					<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="widows: 1">Paging through the bible and
					naming the books in order is important to helping children build
					a mental picture of the shape of the bible: its different parts
					and where to find the different stories. We will always page
					into the bible to find our place. Later we might search from the
					middle, or from the back, or section by section, but early in
					the programme we will repeat the order in the same way each
					lesson, to build familiarity.</P>
