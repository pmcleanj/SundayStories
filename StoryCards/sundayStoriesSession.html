<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><I>The Storyteller invites the
children to sit in a circle around the story materials. It is best to
take a little time to help the children settle, so that they can
focus on the story. If the church uses an overhead projector, and
especially if the story is displayed via webcam on the projector
screen for the adults to see, then it is wise for the circle to be
made so that the children face away from the screen, even if that
put's the Storyteller's back to the congregation. Once the
Storyteller begins the story itself, she should keep her focus on the
story materials rather than on the children's faces.</I></FONT></P>

will be good if the door person has a banner or cross with which to
lead the procession up the aisle to the back of the Sanctuary, and
out and around back down the hallway (after the first lesson, one of

follow behind. The Wonder Leader takes the story materials out the
side door and sets them up in the Wonder Circle before the Doorkeeper
and the children arrive from their Journey.. S/he will need help when
the desert bag is used since it is so heavy. In the Story Room the
Wonder Leader takes a seat at the top of the circle (opposite the
door, in front of the Bible shelf), and puts the tray and desert bag
down in the circle in front of him/her.</FONT></I></P>

work you want to do. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">While

you make your own place you can go get your work, and bring it back

anyone. Like this:</SPAN> <I>Get up, and walk slowly and deliberately

<P STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><B>Some
comments about the lesson plan you have just read:</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The bookmark is the symbol
that the story comes from the Bible. It is coloured for the
liturgical season, and it has a picture on it that represents the
lesson's manipulatives. By seeing it next to the story manipulatives,
children will associate it with the story, even when it is placed
into the actual Bible. We will do this with every lesson, <I>adding </I>a
new bookmark to the Bible each week, so that each week the children
are reminded that they can access any of the stories they have
already heard, just by going back to the Bible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">Paging through the bible and
naming the books in order is important to helping children build a
mental picture of the shape of the bible: its different parts and
where to find the different stories. We will always page into the
bible to find our place. Later we might search from the middle, or
from the back, or section by section, but early in the programme we
will repeat the order in the same way each lesson, to </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>build
familiarity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; font-style: normal">
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The children should
feel ownership of their worship expression, including of their

teach five songs each year: 1) in September, we teach a song for
Journeying back to the church from the Story Room. This is a quiet

are trying to maintain the deep peacefulness they entered into during
their worship response. They begin using this song immediately.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
