<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__45212_835273540"></A>The
Storyteller</H2>
<P>The Storyteller uses manipulatives and visual aids, to tell the
story during “Children's Chat” time in the chancel during the
main church service.</P>
<P>Each story is taken directly from the Bible, retold in the
Storyteller's own words with direct quotes from Scripture. The
“scripts” that follow are not meant to be memorized, but provide
a guideline and example of how scripture quotes are merged with
story-telling. The storyteller should take care not to add any
details or interpretation. Similarly, the Storyteller should avoid
censoring “problematic” details out of the story</P>
<P>Storytelling is experienced as a sacred act. Secular
story-telling, whether by the medium of television or by a performing
artist-storyteller, relies on the storyteller commanding the
audience's attention, and engaging the audience members in
relationship with the storyteller through eye-contact and dramatic
intonation and gesture. In sacred story-telling, the Storyteller
effaces himself or herself, drawing their audience to focus instead
on the story itself. By intently seeing the story materials and
avoiding eye-contact with the child audience, you role-model
appropriate focus. This feels unnatural at first. It feels risky –
how will you control the children's behaviour if you are not looking
at them? Trust that you do not need to control them. You are opening
Scripture to them, you are enabling the Holy Spirit to work in them,
and they <I>want</I> to hear the story. The story becomes a communal
act: God, children and Storyteller each doing their own part.</P>
<P>At the end of the story, the materials will take a few moments to
be packed up. There's no need to rush. Give the basket of materials
to one child to take to the Story Room. Let the children know they
are welcome to stay with the rest of the congregation to worship, or
to follow the Doorkeeper to the Story Room. Give a nod to the music
leader or organist to begin the children's Journey song, and return
to your seat.</P>
<P>The Storyteller then participates normally in the adult worship.
Five minutes before the children need to return, the Storyteller goes
to tell the Doorkeeper that the service is almost over.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Checklist for your turn as the Storyteller:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Read the appointed Scripture.</P>
	<LI><P>Read the Story aloud two or three times</P>
	<LI><P>Practice the Story using the manipulatives</P>
	<LI><P>Rehearse the Story with an audience, for feedback</P>
	<LI><P>Set out the Story materials at the foot of the Altar before

The Doorkeeper</H2>
<P>When the Storyteller dismisses the children, the Doorkeeper leads
the children up the main aisle of the nave to the centre doors, and
around to the long hallway to the Story Room. At the door to the
story room the Doorkeeper reminds the children to “get ready” by
being calm and quiet. As each child becomes calm, the Doorkeeper
invites him or her by name to enter the story room, and then waits
until that child is greeted by the Wonder Leader and finds a seat,
before inviting the next child to enter. When all the children have
entered, the Doorkeeper takes a seat quietly just inside the closed
door, waiting to help as needed. The Doorkeeper may take a child to
the washroom, help a child find his art materials, invite a child to
sit next to him or her if the child cannot settle down in the circle.
When notified by the Storyteller, the Doorkeeper tells the children
that it is time to clean up and may help them put their work away.
When the children are dismissed by the Wonder leader, the Doorkeeper
leads them back to the main doors of the nave, and reminds them to
enter the nave quietly without disturbing the worship there.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">Checklist for your turn as Doorkeeper:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Read the appointed Scripture.</P>
	<LI><P>Fill the wash pitcher with warm water</P>
	<LI><P>Fill the drinks pitcher with cold water</P>
	<LI><P>Refill the large paints and crayons if needed</P>
	<LI><P>Tell the Superintendent if any supplies are needed</P>
	<LI><P>Dump out and wipe the pitchers and basin after worship.</P>
</UL>
<P>It is ideal if all three leaders can meet ahead of time to
rehearse the story together. Wednesday night, when the church is open
for prayer group, worship rehearsal, confirmation class and knitting
group, is a good time to rehearse and if possible to take photos of
the rehearsal for the overhead projector and the church bulletin.</P>

The Wonder Leader</H2>
<P>The Wonder Leader takes the story materials out of the chancel
into the Story Room. He or she places the story materials in the
middle of the Circle, and takes a seat next to the focus shelves,
facing the door. As each child enters the room the Wonder Leader
greets them by name, and helps them choose a place in the circle to
sit. 
</P>
<P>When all the children are seated, the Wonder Leader leads them in
their circle-song to help them become quiet and focussed. As the song
ends, the Wonder Leader directs attention to the story materials, and
begins to “wonder” about them, inviting the children to join in
the wondering.</P>
<P>When the wondering winds down, the Wonder Leader asks the children
to think about what work they want to do. One by one each child is
asked what work he or she wants to do and is dismissed from the
circle to get, first, his rug; and second, his work materials, which
may be art supplies, or story manipulatives for that day's story or
for a story that they have heard previously.</P>
<P>When it is time to clean up, the Wonder leader welcomes the
children back into the circle, and leads them in their sending song,
dismissing them one by one by name to line up at the door.
